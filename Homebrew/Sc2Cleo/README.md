I wrote a homebrew BIN file in pure Assembler for testing. (Starting @140D)  
It loads and decompresses a image in 'Graphics Mode II'<br>

Graphics by  ***Dustin Ramsey***<br><br>
***Tested and working now.***<br><br>

### Thanks to:
***DJ Sures*** for support and testing.<br>
***NI Computer Services*** for testing.
